						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p class="par">
							What if anybody could run as fast as Usain Bolt? What if instead of merely replicating human performance, robotics could significantly improve human performance?
						</p>
						<p class="par">
							In this project, we seek to explore these possibilities, where we seek to develop the hardware and control scheme to develop fast sprinting. Until now, the majority of research has focused on improving walking efficiency or merely supplementing a human walk. We would like to go further and see if we can improve the state of the art in bipedal robotics and set a new world record in sprinting. It would be the equivalent of the ‘Deep Blue’ moment in chess. Where a machine triumphs over man for the first time. We believe robotics has achieved a state where this is possible. We seek to show that new paradigms are possible for bipedal robotics and that peak human performance can be improved with the aid of robotics. The applications span a variety of industries, from medical assistive technology, helping motor impared individuals engage in high-performance activities, to recreation, democratizing high speed sprinting for the common person.

					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<p> When structuring the project, we decided to break it down into four significant sections: <b>gait tracking</b>, <b>mechanical work</b>, <b>electrical work</b>, and <b>control</b>.
					</p>

					<h4>Gait Tracking</h4>
					<p  class="par">The first part of our implementation involves getting the desired behavior our exoskeleton is going to imitate. After deliberating what method would be best to parameterize a gait, we decided to accomplish this by getting the angle at the hip and knee, respectively, over time during a sprint. If we could get these functions, we could also get their derivatives, which would give us sufficient To get these angle profiles, we used computer vision to analyze a video of someone sprinting and extract out the change in angle over time of the knee and hip joints. We utilized the BlazePose package within the MediaPipe Neural Network to analyze images and estimate the position of body joints. The Mediapipe package, extensively tested and trained by Google, enables the use of pre-trained pose estimation to help us identify a set of 28 points on the body for each frame. This allowed us to collect information about the unencumbered, natural gait of individuals without sensors. From these points, we extracted out the ones relevant to the knee and hip angle to help us determine precise values. </p>
					<div class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
						<img src="assets/pose.png" width="400px">	
					</div>
					<p  class="par">The raw angles generated from the video resulted in the following data:</p>
					<div class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
						<img src="assets/gait_raw.png" width="400px">		
					</div>
					<p  class="par">As can be seen above, the angles extracted from the video footage contain a lot of noise and some mislabeled points (the pose estimator switched the left and right legs). To smooth out our data, we filtered out outlier points, as no angle should shift significantly between two adjacent frames, and took a moving average of width 3 to help reduce the effect of noise. Finally, with the filtered and smoothed data, we need to fit a function to the data. For the sake of simplicity, we fit a sine of the form Asin(wt+p)+c to each of the joints. From this method, we get the following fitted lines:

					<div class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
						<img src="assets/gait_final.png" width="400px">		
					</div>
					<p class="par">
					We then save the parameters (A, w, p, and c) for each joint and then feed those into our controller, which is discussed in a later section. 
					</p>

					<h4>Mechanical Design</h4>					
					<p  class="par">In most of robotics applications, gear reducers are essential to amplify the output torque. However, they are known to be expensive and heavy. One of the key aspect of this project in terms of mechanical design is the use of ball screw linear actuator with brush-less motor. As mentioned above, similar design has been seen in a robotics application such as the Spot robot from Boston dynamics. The ball screw converts the rotational motor from the motor into linear reciprocating motion. The biggest advantage of such design consideration is the high gear reduction ratio resulted by motor spinning at high speed with proper pitch setting of the ball screw. Compared with the original output torque of the motor, the high gear ratio amplifies the output thrust force on the ball screw which exerts the proper torque towards the body joints of the exoskeleton. This design eliminates the need for gear reducer which reduced the cost of complexity of the system. As a comparison, the actuation system on MIT Cheetah would cost 300 dollar with only 250 watts output. The actuation system in this project only cost $60 (including the ball screw) with 1350 watts peak power output, which is about 5 times lower in cost and 5 times more powerful.</p>

					<p  class="par">As mentioned above, this design also allows us to position the actuation system of the calf assembly relatively close  to the hip joint, in order to reduce the rotational inertia of the thigh assembly. One notable characteristics of ball screw is its back-drivability. When the motor is not powered, the motion from the leg is able to drive the motor into rotational motion via the linear motion. This feature adds the compliance to the system. As shown below, the link bar system consists of 3 revolute joints and 1 prismatic joint. The first joint represents the hip joint, the second joint works as a lever to push and rotate the hip joint, and the third joint provides additional degree of freedom to the linear actuation. When motor starts to spin in counterclockwise direction (viewed from motor's top perspective), the ball screw nut will travel downwards and vice versa.The second joint is connected with the ball screw nut and travels in an arc trajectory to drive the hip joint and the corresponding thigh beam to rotate. The thigh follows the motion with the help of the fixture bar on thigh beam. Same design are used for both thigh and calf motion, the major difference is that the actuation for thigh is mounted on the waist level while the actuation for calf is mounted on the corresponding thigh.</p>

					<p class="par">
					The mechanical design enabled the linear operation of control between the motor revolution and the hip rotation. The drive system system consists of a tilted four-bar linkage with the linear ball  screw representing one variable length linkage as seen in above. This made kinematics somewhat challenging, but with proper design, we can have mostly perpendicular force application to the hip joint over the range of motion. To simplify the design, we can reduce the four bar linkage to a three-bar linkage with the ball screw linkage is fixed perpendicular to the first linkage. We can align the axis of travel of the ball screw to pass the hip joint tangentially. As a result, a linear extension in ball screw length (through the rotation of the motor), will elongate the linkage in a tangential direction to the axis of rotation. Therefore, motor rotations at the ball screw will approximately correspond to a fixed increase in angle at the hip and knee joints. Through this design , we were able to achieve a very linearized output as seen below. The design allowed an even torque band for the motor so that the amount of torque required by the motor was roughly even throughout through the entire range of motion. The velocity based control system could also be easily implemented.</p>

					</div>	
					<h4>Electrical Design</h4>					
					<p  class="par">A key element of the electrical design was the enable the control of the powerful, inexpensive brushless motors. These motors operate at high speeds that can exceed 10,000 rotations per minute [RPM] and achieve peak power and efficiency at these higher RPM ranges. The initial design made use of electromagnetic field feedback from the brushless motor as a form of feedback control. However this proved to have poor low speed performance so an external high speed magnetic encoder was introduced. Unlike many other types of encoders, these non-contact encoders are capable of spinning and reading signals at the high speeds required in this application. A block diagram of the electrical layout can be seen below. The power flows from a Lithium Polymer battery capable of supplying 24 volts at 200 amps. The encoder feedback is captured by the high speed dual axis motor controller through a high speed Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) lines.</p>

					</div>
					
					<h4>Control</h4>					
					<p  class="par">Finally, we turn to using our desired trajectory with the mechanical and electrical structure of our exoskeleton to drive the motors to perform the sprint. During the time of this project, because of shipping delays, we were unable to get our hands onto encoders for the motors, so, we were unfortunately forced to use velocity control instead of more desirable position control. To overcome this, we took the derivative of our fitted trajectory and, using the linearization referenced in linearized output image above, converted our desired joint velocity into motor revolutions per second (as a function of time). This gave us our feed forward input for the built in velocity controller on the ODrive that allowed us to move both motors in sync with the gait.  </p>

					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p class="par">In doing this project, we have learned a lot about the process of implementing a research idea. While the theory aspect of the project went by relatively smoothly, we learned that bringing an idea to life brings about a whole host of issues. From part delays and bugs to the difficutly of precise manufacturing, building the exoskeleton gave us a massive increase in experience in making a design a reality. Over the last three weeks, we have managed to show that an exoskeleton able to increase max human running speed is not only possible, but can be done with relatively low cost. Nonetheless, a lot of work remains to be done to turn our pieces of implementation into a full picture.</p>

						<h4>Future Work</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><b style="font-size: 20px">Gait Tracking</b></li>
								<p  class="par">On the gait tracking front, the key form of improvement would be using more complex functions to fit the data rather than a simple sine. One way of achieving this would be to fit a linear combination of a set number of sinusoidal functions. Because we know the gait is periodic, we can use a Fourier Transform to make an accurate approximation of the signal for each of the joints, taking into account any asymmetries that may exist within one stride. Additionally, we worked under the assumption that both legs followed the same gait. When fitting this to an individual to try, it would be important to map the gait of the left and right separately to get the controller to be as accurate to the person's natural gait as possible. Finally, as the intention of this project was to be able to run a full sprint, we would need to gather data for the first kick-off phase of the sprint and fit a model to that as well.</p>
							<li><b style="font-size: 20px">Mechanical Design</b></li>
								<p  class="par">For future work, we would like to incorporate more safety features at the joints such as hard stops that wouldn't allow the extension. One of the big fears currently, with regards to safety, is the damage the exoskeleton could do to the wearer if the wearer falls. We would need add rounded edges and perhaps encase the exoskeleton in a softer material to make contact between the wearer and the device less dangerous. We would also like to increase the rigidity of the device since skeleton frame shifts over time due to the mechanical stresses exerted by the drive train. The power transfer would also increase by improving the rigidity of the frame and joints. Adding a degree of freedom to allow more side to side movement would also help with mobility.</p>
							<li><b style="font-size: 20px">Electrical Design</b></li>
								<p  class="par">As referenced throughout this piece, the exoskeleton device could be greatly improved through the use of high speed encoders at the motor and also the joint. This would give us the data necessary to perform high precision position feedback control and would allow us to implement even fancier feedback controllers. Additionally, these encoders could be used to increase the safety of the device, a topic not addressed in our research thus far, checking to make sure these joint limits and velocities are within reasonable bounds to prevent the over-extension of joints. With encoder readings, a way to ensure safety would be to have an emergency stop that triggers if the motors draw too much current or veer outside of the safety bounds with regards to position or velocity. In these instances, we could hand back control to the wearer as the ball screw motors are back-drivable. </p>
							<li><b style="font-size: 20px">Control</b></li>
								<p  class="par">With high speed encoders, we could increase the complexity of our controller. While our current implementation did not incorporate feedback, we could use sensor readings for a PID position controller. By using a position controller, we would ensure that the motor reaches the desired positions even under variable load. The feedback element would increase the accuracy with which each stride is conducted. </p>
